      Freddie Mercury (born Farrokh Bulsara; 5 September 1946 – 24 November
      1991) was a British singer, songwriter, record producer, and lead vocalist
      of the rock band Queen. Regarded as one of the greatest singers in the
      history of rock music, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and
      four-octave vocal range. Mercury defied the conventions of a rock
      frontman, with his highly theatrical style influencing the artistic
      direction of Queen.

      Born in 1946 in Zanzibar to Parsi-Indian parents, he attended
      English-style boarding schools in India from the age of eight and returned
      to Zanzibar after secondary school. In 1964, his family fled the Zanzibar
      Revolution, moving to Middlesex, England. While singing for Wreckage, a
      fellow student introduced Freddie to Roger Taylor and Brian May, founder
      members of a band called Smile. Smile metamorphosed into Queen when
      Freddie joined Roger and Brian as the lead vocalist. The final member of
      the band, which was to stay together for the next 20 years, was bassist
      John Deacon, who joined the band on 1st of March 1971. The rest is rock
      history. EMI Records and Elektra Records signed the band and in 1973 their
      debut album ‘Queen’ was released and hailed as one of the most exciting
      developments ever in rock music.

      As a member of Queen, Mercury was posthumously inducted into the Rock and
      Roll Hall of Fame in 2001, the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2003, and the
      UK Music Hall of Fame in 2004. In 1990, he and the other Queen members
      were awarded the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music,
      and one year after his death Mercury was awarded it individually. In 2005,
      Queen were awarded an Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Song Collection
      from the British Academy of Songwriters, Composers, and Authors. In 2002,
      Mercury ranked number 58 in the BBC's poll of the 100 Greatest Britons.
      His career with Queen was dramatised in the 2018 biopic
      <i>Bohemian Rhapsody.</i>
